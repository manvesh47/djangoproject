Models

To create models first we will create a model class and pass various fields in it .

class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()

    #creating a def str to return the title
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

And then we will use this command in. Terminal to pass the model to our databases 

Python manage.py makemigrations

And then we will use

Python manage.py migrate 

And after this we will go to our admin.py page to register our models there which. We will do in the following way 

# Register your models here.
#first way to register a model

#admin.site.register(Article)

#second way to register a model
@admin.register(Article)
class ArticleModel(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_filter = ('title' , 'description')
